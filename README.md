# 🧠 Multiagent Procurement Framework

This project implements a **Multiagent System (MAS)** that simulates procurement processes within supply chains. It models interactions between multiple autonomous agents (e.g., buyers and suppliers) to explore negotiation strategies, procurement costs, and decision outcomes.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Buyer and Supplier agent definitions
- Customizable negotiation rounds and strategies
- Cost and utility-based performance metrics
- Randomized simulations with repeatable seeds
- Output visualizations for convergence, pricing, and agent behavior

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Multiagent_framework.ipynb`: Main notebook containing agent classes, simulation code, and plots
- Modular code cells for:
  - Agent initialization
  - Procurement simulation
  - Results analysis
